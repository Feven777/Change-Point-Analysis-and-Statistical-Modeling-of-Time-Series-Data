## Assumptions and Limitations

- The analysis assumes that major structural changes in oil prices can be approximated
  as discrete change points.
- Detected change points indicate statistical correlation in time, not direct causality.
- Multiple overlapping events may influence prices simultaneously.
- External macroeconomic variables (GDP, inflation, exchange rates) are not explicitly modeled.
